# base-fall-layered-strat
Matlab functions to model 1-D stream power erosion within layered stratigraphy and extract knickpoint data from model output. Parameter descriptions and examples are included in function headings.
## SPIM_1D_UD
Function to solve the stream power incision model in 1-D using an explicit upwind differencing scheme. Users have full control over Hack's Law, SPIM parameters, and the geometry and number of planar contacts.
## extractknickdata
Companion function to SPIM_1D_UD. Takes in model output and finds knickpoints (defined as break points in channel steepness) at each timestep. Knickpoint elevations are plotted as a function of time, and users can isolate breakpoints to calculate vertical velocities, chi-space celerities, and knickpoint prominence (i.e., cross-knickpoint change in channel steepness) for individual knickpoints through time by drawing a line of at least two points nearest a single knickpoint elevation path. The function also outputs the time vs. elevation plot of each model run, and the user has the option to view the output of SPIM_1D_UD while extractknickdata runs.
